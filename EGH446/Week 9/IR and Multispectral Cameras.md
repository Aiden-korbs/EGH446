Cameras can be designed to see outside the "Visible" light spectrum (400-700 nm).

[Table of electromagnetic spectrum (Gamma, X-Ray, UV, Visible, Infrared, Microwave, Radio)]

## Infrared (IR) Cameras
* **Thermograms** are visual displays of the *infrared energy* (heat) emitted, transmitted, and reflected by an object.
* IR cameras can be **Uncooled** (use sensors that change resistance when heated) or **Cooled** (use cryogenic coolers and are more sensitive).

### IR Bands
* **Near-Infrared (NIR)**: 0.75-1.4 $\mu$m. Used in night vision goggles.
* **Short-Wavelength (SWIR)**: 1.4-3 $\mu$m.
* **Mid-Wavelength (MWIR)**: 3-8 $\mu$m. This is an atmospheric window used by "heat-seeking" missiles to track jet engine exhaust.
* **Long-Wavelength (LWIR)**: 8-15 $\mu$m. This is the **thermal imaging region**. It can create a passive image of objects at room temperature (like a human body) based *only* on their thermal emissions.

### Advantages of IR:
* Can catch moving targets in real-time.
* Non-destructive (e.g., finding defects).
* Can detect objects in complete darkness.

### Disadvantages of IR:
* High price and limited resolutions.
* Images can be hard to interpret.
* Only detects *surface* temperatures.

## Multispectral Cameras
* These sensors are composed of multiple individual channels (e.g., 6) arranged in an array.
* Each channel has its own CMOS sensor and a **user-configurable bandpass filter**.
* This allows the camera to simultaneously capture multiple specific wavelengths of light (e.g., Blue @ 450nm, Green @ 530nm, Red @ 670nm, Near-Infrared @ 780nm).
* Used extensively in agriculture and environmental monitoring.

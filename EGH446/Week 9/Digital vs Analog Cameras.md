## Analog Cameras
* The chemical component in a traditional camera is **film**.
* When exposed to light, tiny light-sensitive grains on a plastic strip undergo a chemical reaction, creating a record of the light pattern.

## Digital Cameras
* A digital camera is an alteration of the analog camera, but instead of film, it uses **image sensors**.
* The image sensors are typically either a **Charge Coupled Device (CCD)** or a **Complimentary Metal Oxide Semi-conductor (CMOS)**.
* This is a major shift, allowing for the saving and sharing of digital content.
* Digital cameras produce 0s and 1s, which are stored as strings of tiny dots called **pixels**.

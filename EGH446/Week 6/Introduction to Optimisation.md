#EGH446 #Week6 #Optimisation

This week introduces the fundamental concepts of **optimisation**, which is the process of finding the best possible solution from a set of alternatives based on a specific criterion. We'll focus on **unconstrained optimisation**, where the goal is to find the minimum or maximum of a function without any limits on the input values.

## Core Concepts

* **[[Unconstrained Optimisation]]**: Learn the basic ideas, including cost functions, stationary points (minima, maxima, saddle points), and how to use derivatives to classify them.
* **[[Solving Optimisation Problems]]**: Explore the three main methods for finding optimal solutions: brute-force search, gradient-based smart searches, and the analytical calculus-based approach.
* **[[Engineering Applications of Optimisation]]**: See how these concepts are applied to real-world engineering challenges like parameter estimation, system design, and process optimisation.

## Extension Topics

While this week focuses on unconstrained problems, many real-world scenarios involve **constraints**, which are limits on the design choices. These problems are posed as:
* Minimise $F(x)$
* Subject to $g(x)\le0$ (inequality constraints) and $h(x)=0$ (equality constraints).
Solving these is considerably more complex.

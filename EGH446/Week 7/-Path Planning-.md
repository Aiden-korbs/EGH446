#PathPlanning #PGNC #Algorithms

This week revisits the PGNC framework and dives into **Path Planning**. This is the high-level task of finding an optimal or feasible curve through space from a start point to a goal, avoiding obstacles.

It is distinct from motion or trajectory planning, as it is not parameterized by time. It's the sequence of locations to travel, without specifying the speed.

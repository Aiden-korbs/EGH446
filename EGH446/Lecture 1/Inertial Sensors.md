### Description
Sensors that measure motion of the body they are attached to, without external references.
### Types
- **Accelerometers**: Measure linear acceleration (via Newton’s Second Law).
	- An accelerometer can be broadly classified as mechanical or solid state device

- **Gyroscopes**: Measure angular velocity (rate of rotation).
	- That is, an angular displacement per unit of time or rad/sec or deg/sec
	- Exists in three common configurations: Mechanical, optical and MEMS. 
### Characteristics
- Self-contained and environment-independent
- Do not rely on external signals
- Classified as passive sensors

### Applications
- Aircraft, spacecraft, drones
- Robotics
- Navigation for mobile devices and vehicles

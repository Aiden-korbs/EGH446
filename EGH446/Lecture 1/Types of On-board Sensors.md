### Overview
On-board sensors are generally categorised as:
### Active Sensors
- Emit energy (e.g., electromagnetic waves) and detect reflections.
- Examples: Radar, LiDAR, sonar

	**Advantages**
	- Capable of operating in low-visibility conditions
	- Provide direct range and velocity information
	
	**Disadvantages**
	- High power consumption
	- Larger and more complex
	- Emissions can be detected (non-stealth)
	- Depend on surface reflectivity for performance

### Passive Sensors
- Detect naturally occurring energy from the environment.
- Examples: Cameras, infrared detectors, inertial sensors

	**Advantages**
	- Smaller, lighter, and simpler
	- Lower power requirements
	- Harder to detect
	
	**Disadvantages**
	- Limited by environmental conditions (e.g. lighting)
	- Require complex signal processing to extract information

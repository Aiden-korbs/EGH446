#DecisionMaking #Models

**Decision making** is the study of identifying and choosing alternatives based on the values and preferences of the decision maker. It implies that multiple choices are available, and the goal is to select the one that best fits the agent's goals and objectives.

## Types of Decision Making
* **Individual**: Only one entity makes a decision.
* **Group**: Aggregates different individual preferences on a set of alternatives to a single collective preference. This assumes all individuals face a common problem and are interested in finding a solution.

## Decision Context
Decisions can also be classified by the environment and criteria:
* **Risk and Uncertainty**: The outcome of an action may not be known with certainty.
* **Criteria**: The decision can be based on a **single criterion** or **multiple criteria**.
* **Alternatives**: The choice can be from a **finite** set of alternatives (e.t., turn left, turn right) or an **infinite** set (e.g., any steering angle from -30 to +30 degrees).

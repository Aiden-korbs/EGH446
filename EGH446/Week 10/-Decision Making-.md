This week covers **Decision Making** for autonomous systems. This is the study of identifying and choosing alternatives based on the values and preferences of the decision maker.

Making a decision implies that there are alternative choices to be considered. The goal is to choose the one that best fits with the system's objectives, desires, and values.

## What is an autonomous system?
Autonomous systems (e.g., surface, maritime, aerospace vehicles) are capable of **guiding**, **navigating**, and **controlling** themselves to achieve tasks in 3D environments.

## Assumed knowledge & tools
- Prior control/dynamics (e.g., EGB345) and a 3rd-year design unit.
- Strong MATLAB/Simulink skills (used extensively).

## Delivery & workload
- Pre-recorded lectures + weekly Q&A/demo lecture.
- Tutorials (selected weeks) and workshops (selected weeks).
- Expect ~12 hrs/week effort.

## Assessment (typical)
- Major MATLAB/Simulink project (Part A & B) ≈ 60% total.
- Final exam ≈ 40%.

## Big picture skills
- Move between **concrete ↔ abstract**: model reality, analyze with math, implement on hardware.
- Think in **PGNC** terms: Planning, Guidance, Navigation, Control.

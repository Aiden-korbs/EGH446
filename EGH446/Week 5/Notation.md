## General Rules
- Lowercase = vectors, Uppercase = matrices.
- Continuous-time: $x(t)$ or $x_t$
- Discrete-time: $x_k$ or $x(k)$
- $f(\cdot)$, $h(\cdot)$ for functions (possibly nonlinear).
- Noise processes:
  - $w_k$, $v_k$ for measurement and process noise.
- Dimensions: $N, M, P$ as needed.
- $\mathbb{R}^{N \times N}$ = set of $N \times N$ real matrices.

## Filtering
- **Goal**: Separate signal from noise.
- Recursive process — updates whenever new measurement arrives.
- Not necessarily frequency-domain filtering.

## Optimality
- "Optimal" = minimum variance of estimation error.
- Necessary because signal and noise spectra often overlap.

## Kalman Filter (KF)
- Recursive filter providing optimal state estimate.
- Combines all available information to minimise mean square error.
- Applications: guidance, robotics, navigation.
